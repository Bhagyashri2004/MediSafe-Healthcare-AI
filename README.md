# AI-Powered Healthcare & Medicine Quality Website

Ensuring access to quality healthcare and authentic medicines is a 
significant challenge, especially in rural areas where delayed diagnosis, 
improper treatment, and substandard medicines pose serious health 
risks. This project aims to develop an AI-powered web application that 
assists users in verifying medicine quality and predicting diseases 
based on symptoms, making healthcare more accessible and reliable. 
The system provides two key features: a Medicine Quality Checker, 
where users can enter a medicineâ€™s name or ingredients to verify its 
authenticity, cross-checking information with medical databases to 
detect low-quality or unsafe medicines while suggesting safer 
alternatives; and a Disease Prediction & Medicine Recommendation 
tool, which allows users to input symptoms and receive AI-based 
predictions of possible diseases. The system then provides treatment 
recommendations based on Ayurveda, Homeopathy, or Allopathy, 
enabling users to choose their preferred medical approach. By offering 
accurate medical insights, ensuring safe medicine consumption, and 
improving healthcare accessibility, this solution empowers individuals 
to make informed health decisions and enhances overall well-being.
